A Tale of Two Coasts: Unveiling U.S. Gulf and Atlantic Coastal Cities at High Flood Risk
Dataset DOI: 10.5061/dryad.bzkh189q7
Description of the data and file structure
This study develops a data-driven framework of flood risk modelling to unveil flood-prone cities, estimate exposed population, and identify underlying factors of flood risk under two scenarios: General Flood Damage (GFD) and Extreme Flood Damage (EFD) along the U.S. Gulf and Atlantic Coast (USGAC). You will find all associated data and codes used in this study.
Files and variables
File: Flood_Damage_Data.zip
Description: This study utilized direct flood damages to human property from FEMA website (https://disasters-geoplatform.hub.arcgis.com/pages/historical-damage-assessment-database). A total of 52,710 flood damage locations across all levels of damage, i.e., affected, minor, major, and destroyed, were used in the GFD scenario and, a subset (19,272) destroyed locations was utilized for the EFD scenario. These flood damage locations are associated with multiple recent hurricane-induced flood events including 2012 Hurricane Isaac, 2012 Hurricane Sandy, 2016 Hurricane Hermine, 2016 Hurricane Matthew, 2016 Louisiana Flood, 2017 Hurricane Harvey, 2017 Hurricane Irma and 2017 Hurricane Nate.

File: FRFs.zip
Description: A variety of factors including topography, precipitation pattern, geological features, vegetation cover and anthropogenic features, play a critical role in shaping flood dynamics, either through direct or indirect influence. They are known as flood risk factors. Based on extensive literature review, a total of 16 FRFs are selected, including eight hazard-related factors, three exposure-related factors (Fig. 6c), and five vulnerability-related factors.

File: Shapefiles.zip
Description: All shapefiles are included here.

File: Cities_EFD_GFD.zip
Description: All shapefiles associated with high-risk cities are included. 

File: Codes_USGAC.zip
Description: All codes including flood risk factors processing, flood risk modelling, SHAP analysis, and uncertainty tests are included. 

Code/software
Google Earth Engine, Python, and ArcGIS Pro are used to process and analyze the data.
